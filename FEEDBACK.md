#### Feedback:  

Excellent work with your project, Alban! You met the technical requirements for this project! You chose a great problem to solve and I really like how you used an API as a data source. This was very creative and shows that you really wanted to practice making server-side HTTP requests.

Your code looked great, I was just concerned about your screenshot files being located in your config directory and you also have what appears to be a data seed file pushed to production as well.

Lastly, I didn't see a link to your trello board in your project's README and your Trello board didn't have any user stories in it as well.

All in all, you did a fantastic job with this project, Alban!
